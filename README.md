# Denotia

An ML-based FTLD detector, Denotia is Python web app employing an image-classifying deep learning model to predict rare neurological diseases from MRI scans. 

We employed:
- FreeSurfer and GrayNet to process T1-weighted MRI scans from FTLDNI,
- PyTorch Geometric to build the GNN, and
- Heroku to create and deploy the web app for end-user access.

Software Used: Python3, FreeSurfer, GrayNet, PyTorch Geometric, Heroku

Web App: https://denotia.herokuapp.com/
