<p class = x1> Frequently Asked Questions </p>

<p class = x2> > What is Denotia? </p>
<hr width="70%">
<p class = x3> Denotia is a web-based application that uses an image-classifying machine learning model to predict rare neurological diseases 
from brain scans, such as FTLD. </p>

<p class = x2> > How common is FTLD? </p>
<hr width="70%">
<p class = x3> Despite being a rare disease (NORD link), it is the second most common form of dementia for people under 65. 
It usually occurs between 40 to 75 and often goes misdiagnosed/undiagnosed. As it is irreversible, it is important to classify 
it at an early stage to ensure specific interventions, timely management with symptomatic treatment, and caregiver sensitization.</p>

<p class = x2> > How do I use Denotia? </p>
<hr width="70%">
<p class = x3> Simple! Just go to our <a href = "{{ url_for ('index') }}" class = link1>homepage</a>, upload your scan and click upload. Once processed, you'll be able to view the algorithm's prediction. </p>

<p class = x2> > How does Denotia work? </p>
<hr width="70%">
<p class = x3> Our machine-learning model was built on Python and trained using scans from <a href = "{{ url_for ('ftldni') }}" class = link1>FTLDNI</a>, the largest database for FTD scans. 
It has learnt to recognize surrogate markers of FTLD and continuously improves, thereby aiding in diagnosis of the disorder.</p>
